## This is the defaults file, that will be merged with the distribution
## specific YAML.
##
## Given that each distribution might have different default values, this
## file is also processed by jinja before merging with the distribution
## configuration
##

## The root level entry must be unique, but not necesseraly tied to a
## distribution. Each root level entry will generate a new template in
## the `templates` folder.
##
## Special cases:
##   - `defaults`: this defines the defautl values for the templates
##   - `globals`: some global definitions
defaults:
  ## @warning: The warning to print at the top of each generated file
  ##
  warning: "THIS FILE IS GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT"

  ## @distribution: The distribution name
  ##
  ## Each template will be given the `{distribution}.yml` name
  ##
  ## Mandatory
  distribution: ""

  ## @version: The version used in the template
  ##
  ## Note that this might be overwritten by the $REPO_SUFFIX later by users
  version: ""

  ## @versions: Which versions are tested in the CI
  ##
  ## Mandatory if "version" is not defined
  versions: [{{version}}]

  ## @package_type: The package type supported by the distribution
  ##
  ## This has no "real" effect but to use debs on debian/ubuntu and rpms on
  ## fedora/centos
  ##
  ## Mandatory
  package_type: ""

  ## @upgrade: The list of commands that are used to upgrade the container image
  ##
  ## This needs to be a list
  ##
  ## Mandatory
  upgrade: []

  ## @install: The list of commands that are used to install a package in
  ##           the container image
  ##
  ## This needs to be a list
  ##
  ## Mandatory
  install: []

  ## @clean: The list of commands that are used to remove leftovers from
  ##         the package manager in the final container image
  ##
  ## This needs to be a list
  ##
  ## Mandatory
  clean: []

  ## @aarch64: Does the upstream docker image is aarch64 capable
  ##
  ## boolean
  aarch64: true

  ## @qemu_packages: list of packages that are required on a base qemu image
  ##
  ## if this variable is not defined, the matching qemu template will not
  ## be generated
  qemu_packages: ""

  ## The following variables are inferred and don't need to be overwritten by
  ## the distributions

  ## @image: The base image to pull on docker
  ##
  ## Some distribution (alpine, arch, ...) have only one upstream image
  ## we can pull
  {% if not version %}

  ## @PACKAGES: the produced environment variable for the list of packages to
  ##            install in the final container
  PACKAGES: "{{DISTRIBUTION}}_{{PACKAGE_TYPE}}"

  ## @VERSION: the produced environment variable for $DISTRO_VERSION
  ##
  ## Note: this is a special case and "VERSION" can not be overwritten by
  ##       the YAML file, and will always take the value defined here
  {% if not version %}
  VERSION: "${{DISTRIBUTION}}_VERSION"
  {% else %}
  VERSION: "{{version}}"
  {% endif %}

  ## @version_examples: Examples of versionning you can have for a distro
  ##
  ## This is purely to prettify the generated template, but will only
  ## be used if "version" is not defined in the YAML file.
  ##
  {% if versions %}
  version_examples: {{ ', '.join(versions) }}
  {% else %}

  ## @qemu: controls whether we should create the qemu templates or not

  ## This is purely to prettify the generated template.
  ##
